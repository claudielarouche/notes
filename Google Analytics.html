<b class="wikidpad">When creating account</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Benchmarking is, you're going to contribute your data to this anonymous benchmark, such that you can see those benchmarks back yourself and how you compare to those.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Analytics</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Not only how visitors are reaching your site, but how to evaluate the VALUE of each of those visitors.<br class="wikidpad" />
Exactly how your visitors are interacting with, and using your site's content.<br class="wikidpad" />
Track all of your marketing with Google Analytics<br class="wikidpad" />
Identify areas of your site that perform well and those that don't<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Modern business intelligence and digital analytics tools give us the ability to collect a staggering amount of data. We want to take that raw data, organize it into something that we can use, something actionable and something that has importance to us and meaning to us as people. What we really care about, is the performance of the content and how the visitors are interacting with the site. Which marketing channels are driving business? Which devices are my users using?<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Web Analytics is the study of online behaviour in order to improve it - Wikipedia<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Analytic software is like an x-ray machine. In this case, the patient is your website and the x-ray machine is Google Analytics. The tool, will identify and display exactly what's going on under the skin of your website, much like this x-ray will detect and display the broken bones. However, it won't end your pain and it won't ultimately fix your problem. For that you're going to need someone who can actually read and interpret the x-ray, and perform the analysis necessary to actually take action and improve the situation. Analytics alone is NOT ENOUGH. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Assess situation<br class="wikidpad" />
Prioritize problems<br class="wikidpad" />
Find solutions<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Constantly analyzing, adjusting, improving and optimizing.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Web Analytics is a process and set it and forget it has no place here. We first perform the measurement, we apply analysis and we learn from what we see. And then we take action. Our site is constantly changing, our marketing is changing, the tools themselves are changing, and the devices in which we access that online content, are rapidly and continually changing. We need to make sure our Analytics process doesn't become stale, but rather evolves and keeps up with those changes, in order to ensure our site is always performing at its best.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Goals</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Goals are what will allow us to evaluate quality traffic from poor performing traffic.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Goals are a fundamental concept of any analytics package, and without goals, you have nothing more than a fancy hit counter. In other words, in order for us to say that site A is sending you much more valuable traffic than site B, we need some criteria to base that on, and that's where goals come in.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
There's high performing traffic, low performing traffic, and everything in between. In order to analyze which sources and types of traffic are valuable, we need to track what those visitors are doing when they're on the site, what content works, how they're using the site, and ultimately figure out how to segment them and understand why they're doing what they're doing. Finally, we're going to measure how many folks and which segments of those people reach that final step and convert. Whether it's putting money in your bank account, or filling that lead-gen form, we get to tell our analytics package exactly what we consider a successful visit by setting a goal. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
One very important point about goals is not to overlook intermediate goals, sometimes known as micro conversions. We're often so focused on that last step, such as a shopping cart checkout, that we forget about all the factors in between that contribute to the sale and get them to take that next step<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Attract traffic<ul class="wikidpad normalindent">- Paid ads<br class="wikidpad" />
- Organic searches<br class="wikidpad" />
- Email marketing<br class="wikidpad" />
- Offline marketing<br class="wikidpad" />
</ul>
2. Track Action<ul class="wikidpad normalindent">- Add item to shopping cart<br class="wikidpad" />
- Fill out a form<br class="wikidpad" />
- Download coupons<br class="wikidpad" />
- Find a phone number<br class="wikidpad" />
</ul>
3. Measure conversion<ul class="wikidpad normalindent">- Completing a sale<br class="wikidpad" />
- Completing a form<br class="wikidpad" />
</ul>
You can set up a maximum of 20 goals per view. If you need more goals, you can always create another view. Goals have their own section in Google Analytics under Conversions.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Configuring Goals</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
One important configuration is that we can actually assign a monetary value to a goal. This allows us to get revenue, without having to have a full blown e-commerce setup. And the idea here is that if you know a particular goal's estimated to be worth a certain amount to you, and each time a visitor reaches that goal, Google Analytics is actually going to attribute that revenue to that visitor and all the segments with it. So, the landing page, the source, the medium, all the things associated with that visitor.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Why do you have a website?<br class="wikidpad" />
- E-commerce<br class="wikidpad" />
- Support<br class="wikidpad" />
- Call us<br class="wikidpad" />
- Mailing list<br class="wikidpad" />
- Information<br class="wikidpad" />
- Affiliates / Ads<br class="wikidpad" />
- Human Resources<br class="wikidpad" />
- Lead Generation<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Go to the website<br class="wikidpad" />
2. Do the full steps of a succesful visit<br class="wikidpad" />
3. Copy every single URL along the way<br class="wikidpad" />
4. Go into Google Analytics &gt; Admin &gt; View &gt; Goals &gt; New goal<br class="wikidpad" />
5. Fill all the information, now make sure that you don't copy the full URL but only the URI: /calendar/<ul class="wikidpad normalindent">Feel free to use regular expression if need be: /calendar/|/fr/calendrier/ </ul>
6. Fill the funnel if that makes sense (different steps leading to the end result). Make sure you do not put the goal destination as a funnel step.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If you do conduct transactions online, one of the most important goals you'll want to measure, is the goal of collecting money, and there's a whole set of reports dedicated to just that topic. To get the info from these reports, you do need to integrate Google Analytics with your shopping cart, so your shopping cart, or check out software, will send all the data with the results of those transactions, back to Google servers<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Goal Reports</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Reverse goal path report:<br class="wikidpad" />
This report shows us some a unique navigation path that was used to complete the goal. This is an interesting report because it compares what our predicted path might be. Something we would set up in a funnel, where we predict what it's going to be with what the user actually did. So, unlike funnels, that start with the beginning pages, and work towards the end conversion, this actually starts with the goal and works backwards to see where the most common paths are. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Averages</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Misinformation is often worse than no information. Averages can lie. Even if the underlying data is 100% accurate. For example, if your feet are frozen and your head is on fire, on average, you're doing fine. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Most often, the real insights lie when we can segment out groups of visitors and understand their behaviour. Then we can see who's really driving the success.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Segmentation</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Segmentation is the first step in true analysis. And we have tons and tons of ways to segment visitors in Google Analytics<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Type of segmentation:<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Geographic locations<br class="wikidpad" />
2. Traffic sources<br class="wikidpad" />
3. Site actions<br class="wikidpad" />
4. Offline traffic sources<br class="wikidpad" />
5. Intent (keywords typed in search engine can give insight)<br class="wikidpad" />
6. Landing page<br class="wikidpad" />
7. Browser<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
And thus the ability to segment by landing page can be quite revealing. In fact, simply splitting the site into two groups, those who reached our goals versus those who didn't. Just as examining successes or failures in any aspect of life is useful, examining successful and unsuccessful visitors to our website can give us insight into how we can optimize and improve. If you're split testing your ads, you’ll want to understand how the segments that saw one ad performed versus another. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Now beyond just mobile versus desktop, we can also get detail reports that tell us about things like, connection speed, screen resolution, and other segmentation information that will help us design sites, that are optimal for our user base.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Trends and context</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Take this example:<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Source				Goal convertion<br class="wikidpad" />
Google.com				28.90%<br class="wikidpad" />
Answers.com				94.1%<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Answers.com looks much better but if we add more data:<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Source				Goal convertion			Number of visits<br class="wikidpad" />
Google.com				28.90%					80 427<br class="wikidpad" />
Answers.com				94.1%					    17<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Now google.com is much better.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Always analyze your Analytics in context of external factors. Example: conversion is better on a sunny day then during hurricane. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Accidental competition: Other companies or organizations that share the same name or keywords online (example: Hilton hostel in Paris vs. Paris Hilton)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Let's say you have a trend in your business where Mondays have better conversion than other days of the week. If you then compare an e-mail campaign that runs on a Monday vs an e-mail campaign that runs on a Sunday, the Monday campaign has a better chance of success and we may then conclude the wrong thing, just because we didn't take the trends into account. Most trends are more than just days of the week, but seasonal as well.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Understanding trends will allow us to compare apples to apples by controlling for those external factors, and keeping our data in context<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">How does Google Analytics work</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Now the way Google Analytics works is based on the current generation of web analytics tools and has a very important difference from the older log file based systems in that it cuts out the web server logs, almost entirely from that process. When the web server returns the page back to your browser, it has some embedded JavaScript which is actually the code that runs Google Analytics. That Google Analytics code snippet collects information from your browser, and sends it directly to Google's powerful data centers. Now in addition to that JavaScript that runs in that standard web browser, we can also have that data sent back by mobile apps, and now even non-computer devices like coffee makers and virtually anything that can put the data in the right format.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The data is sent back to Google by what's known as the Measurement Framework. All that data is collected from those devices and visitors and ultimately stored in large databases. When you and I go log into Google Analytics, we open up the reporting database that's connected to those databases. When you think about it, your browser sends all the data to Google. And it actually has almost nothing to do with your web server that hosts your site, other than the fact that your site has that JavaScript snippet included as part of the page that it serves up. Depending on how much traffic you have, and the type of Google Analytics account you have, there can be a wide variance in how long it takes from the time a visitor sees the web page, until the data from that visit shows up in our reports.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Views</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can create up to 25 views. At least each Web property should have 3 different views:<br class="wikidpad" />
- Main view where you do the majority of your analysis<br class="wikidpad" />
- Test view where you can test new filters, make mistakes, etc.<br class="wikidpad" />
- Raw, unfiltered view<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The data is stored in the property, not in the views<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Other possible views:<br class="wikidpad" />
- Internal traffic.<br class="wikidpad" />
- AdWords traffic.<br class="wikidpad" />
- Specific people who work in the organization. <br class="wikidpad" />
- Specific tests that we are running<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
To create views: Admin &gt; Drop-down under view, create a new view<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Interface</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The standard reporting tab includes all the built-in reports for this particular view.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Left menu:<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Dashboards<br class="wikidpad" />
2. Shortcuts<br class="wikidpad" />
3. Intelligence Events<br class="wikidpad" />
4. Real Time: shows what's happening on your site right now.<br class="wikidpad" />
5. Audience: includes reports about Demographics, Behavior, Technology, Geography and Mobile. <br class="wikidpad" />
6. Acquisition: includes reports broken down by medium and other campaign data, reports that are dedicated to search engine optimization and advertising, which will show multiple reports specific to AdWords. And if you've linked AdWords and Google Analytics accounts together, you'll get even more data there. <br class="wikidpad" />
7. Behaviour: gives you details about the performance of your content, the engagement with your content and the site's search reports. If you configure Google Analytics to work with an internal site search box that you have on your website, you'll see that data here. <br class="wikidpad" />
8. Conversion: houses information about Goals you've set up, e-commerce, if you've enabled that for your profile, and multi-channel funnel reports to give you greater insights into how users find your sites over time, even over multiple visits. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
In the mid pane you have a graph which you can add a second metric on (next to vs.) You can change the time period on the right. For some reports, you can add individual rows by selecting them and clicking "plot rows".<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
To compare two date ranges, go to the very top where you have your date range, click on it and select "Compare to". Sometimes it makes much more sense to change the date range slightly so that you are comparing a Monday with a Monday... When comparing one month vs another, make sure you compare the same amount of days especially if comparing amounts (total number of visitors, total revenue, etc.) Also keep in mind # of holidays in a month.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
To add an annotation to the graph, click on the arrow under the graph. You can tell that there is a note by the icon on the date itself. You must have the permission of Collaborate or above on the entire view to be able to modify or add shared notes, but you can always add your own private ones.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Audience Reports</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The reports under the Audience tab give us the most sought after information about the number and type of visitors as well as some basic information about the nature of their visit.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
One of the most illuminating segments to consider about our visitors, is simply where they're from, geographically speaking when they visit our site<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Audience &gt; Geo reports</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
We can also move to E-commerce tab and we can see metrics that are related to commerce themselves, if they're enabled in this particular profile. You can get this information from Audience &gt; Geo &gt; Location. If looking at the US, you will notice that your map looks very similar in colours to a map from the sensus of population density. So this map report doesn't tell you much if you look at it as "number of sessions". More populous states will obviously have more sessions. But this map report can become more interesting if you look at it using other metrics such as "average amount of time people spend on the site" (avg. session duration), or e-commerce conversation rate.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You must realize that the geographic location report is not 100% accurate (due to network, VPN, etc.)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The language report is also very enlightening. If you see a language code you don't recognize, you can look it up here: <span class="wikidpad url-link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes" class="wikidpad">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes</a></span> This language code comes from the browser. The language report isn't one you're going to access daily, but it can be very useful when you're trying to answer specific questions.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Audience &gt; Behavior Reports</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Thinking of your website users as "dates" is a good analogy. If you treat returning visitors every time as if it was their first time, or if you treat first-time visitors as if they've known you for years, things are likely not going to work very well. So it makes sense to analyze Analytics data in segments of "first visit" vs "returning visitor" and compare how the site is performing for both groups.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Google Analytics track first visit vs. returning visitors through cookies. Which means that if the same person uses a different browser, they will be tracked as a new visitor. If you delete your cookies in the browser, you will also be tracked as a new visitor. Same thing for incognito browsing or private browsing windows. Same as well for visitors who visit from work and then from home.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can find this new vs. returning information in the report under Audience &gt; Behaviour &gt; New vs. returning. For this report, the graph only shows you the total for both new vs. returning so here it makes sense to go in the data table, select both new and returning and click the button "Plot Rows" to see totals, new AND returning in the graph. It also makes sense to turn on the pie chart.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
New Vs. Returning is not 100% accurate, and looking at returning visitors as one big group isn't entirely accurate either. To further segment the returning visitors, you can look at the report Audience &gt; Behaviour &gt; Frequency and Recency report, which gives us an idea of how many times users are coming back to the site. If you see big numbers at the bottom of the charts where it counts people that have done 100+ visits, this may be because of the employees of the organization that visit the site on a daily basis. You can also look at the section "Days since last session" in the same report, but keep in mind that over 30 days, it is more likely that users have gotten rid of their cookies, changed computers, etc.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The next report in this section is the Engagement report. And the session duration metric is a highly illuminating report, because it exposes just how misleading these averages can be, and it's pretty well known within user experience circles that most people spend less than ten seconds on a given page, which is backed up by this data. For example, in the Overview report, you may have seen that the average session is 1 minute 23 seconds whereas the vast majority of users only spend 10 seconds on the site. Don't rely too much on averages! And that means that this Engagement report can be very revealing of the true situation of a website. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
A new visit starts any time you either open a new web browser, or let 30 minutes lapse, since the last page you saw on that site. So if you go have lunch, come back to your browser to the same website you were on earlier, that will be counted as a second visit to the site.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Audience &gt; Technology Reports</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Browser &amp; OS Report: Contains a few individual reports in different tabs about browsers, Operating Systems, screen resolution, screen colors, flash version and Java support. Using this report on the browser tab, you can go to the goal section to find out if one of the browser has suspiciously low activities to find out if your website is working on all browsers.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
I haven't seen a client yet interested in the colour report.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Audience &gt; Mobile Reports</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Mobile devices are becoming increasingly important in the web analytics world. In Google Analytics, we have two reports to help us analyze mobile web traffic. The first of these is the mobile overview report. This report allows us to quickly isolate different types of mobile traffic, and evaluate that traffic against things like total sessions, bounce rate, revenue generated, and so on. Now if we use the Plot Rows functionality, we can see how each type of mobile, so phone and tablet, stacks up against desktop.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Devices report: Here we can evaluate mobile traffic by the device that's used<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
We can even get a picture of each device. So if you can't remember if the Nexus 4 was a smart phone or a tablet, you can just click this little camera icon here to launch a picture of the device and you can see if it was or wasn't. We can also look at the devices rolled up to the brand of the phone manufactures, Apple and Samsung and Nokia, et cetera. We can also look at things like the different service providers. So here we're going to see whether it's Verizon, Comcast, Sprint, Nextel. We can even look at things like whether or not the device has a touchscreen, we click here in the mobile input selector, it's going to tell us if it's a, stylus based phone like the Palm Pre was, or even a click wheel phone like the Blackberries.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Audience &gt; User Flow</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Earlier, I said that the acquisition report was my go to report for new clients, because it gives me such an efficient backgrounder. But this interactive report might just take the crown as my favorite to use. Here's a report, that combines the content navigation, entrance and exits reports, and funnels, all in one, and at the same time, it leverages all of our campaign data, and custom segmentation. In this report, the pages of your site are represented by the green boxes over on the right, known as nodes. Visitors and paths and the trends that they take through the site, are represented by these individual lines, which we can actually highlight by clicking on one of them. Starting pages are actually the landing pages. From there, we can see how many visitors moved on, from their landing page, to another page on the site, which page, and we can see how many of them left the site entirely and dropped off, after visiting a particular page.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The number of visitors that left the website, after reviewing the page, are represented by the red bar on the right-hand side. This is a visual representation of the percentage of visitors that abandon the site, and don't move on any further. Now, above the red bar, for the visitors that didn't drop off, we can see through the lines where they moved on to. And we can click on any one of these lines, to highlight the traffic through that particular path, and see all the people who came to this point, where they originally came from, and then where they went as they moved on, including, where did they eventually drop off. Now, if we're to go back on the first column here and click on any one of the dimension nodes, we can also highlight the traffic through that particular country.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If we only have interest in a particular country, we can click the second option "view only this segment". At that point, it's going to clear away all the other ones and just show us the segment that we're currently interested in.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Now another good tip, is that on any individual nodes, I can click on it, and I can select Group Details. From here, we're going to see a table with different metrics about the pages that are included here. The top page is, is thereby default, but we can also change this drop-down to see things like the traffic breakdown, which is going to show that, the various counties that came through this page. And even things like the outgoing traffic, which shows where they went, after they came through this page. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
One any of the pages, you can click on the node and click "Explore traffic through here". Click on the plus on either side to understand where people came from prior to go to that page and where they went after. You can use the zoom to see some parts better.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
When you "Explore traffic through here", there is an edit button on the main page and you can change the expression used if you wish. Then, by clicking the node again and clicking group detail, you can see all the pages that are now included in that node.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Acquisition tab reports</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If I could pick only one tab to do all my work, it would be the Acquisition tab. Whenever I examine a client's account for the first time, these reports are the first place I go<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Overview: Google Analytics is going to split up all of our traffic into a few default buckets that we can see here in the overview report, where we've got a nice graphical overview that's going to give you a pretty valuable bird's eye view of the sources of traffic that drive your site<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Channels Report: Now, anyone who's serious about the website, should be able to immediately answer questions such as what is your best performing source of traffic? What is your worse? Which channel or medium sends you the most traffic? Which channel gets you the best bang for your buck? And even questions like, how is your offline marketing comparing to your online sources? All of those are easy, once you get the hang of making this report work for you.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Acquisition &gt; Channels</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
My favourite report and this is the first one I'm going to go to if I get a new client because it provides so much information about the current state of the site and how they generate, engage, and convert their traffic in one convenient report. So we have all the traffic segmented into these rows, known as Dimensions on the Left. They represent the way the visitor came to the site. On the other side, the columns are known as Metrics<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
New users: tell us about the traffic we are acquiring during the acquisition section. <br class="wikidpad" />
Duration of the visit: average session duration, this is going to speak about the behaviour once they're on the site. <br class="wikidpad" />
Goal completions: tell us whether or not they converted. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
This tabular format presents a lot of data, but for us humans it's not particularly easy to remember, compare, interpret information when it's just a bunch of numbers in a big table. So you can view this data in pie chart, graph etc. by clicking on the buttons next to the search field. The icon comparison is going to be comparing the current numbers with the site average. Each of these bars are relative to the site average, so if the bar is on the right-hand side, it's performing worse than average, on the left hand side, better than average (for bouce rate for example). So you can compare the quality of your traffic, for example two sources of traffic may bring the same amount of people but one of them might have a good bounce rate while the other not so much.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
This quantity and quality combination is just such a critical point that I want to emphasize. In these two columns we have the two critical things we need to know. We need to know how it's performing overall, but we also need the number of visits to know what it is in the context of the volume. After all, somebody has a great bounce rate, but it only brings one or two visits. It isn't necessarily something that's important to me as a site owner<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
A good bounce rate can be correlated directly to our revenue and other performance indicators. A lower bounce rate is good.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can also look at this report by pivoting, last icon. Pivot by city for example.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Acquisition &gt; All Traffic</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The All Traffic report is very similar to the Channels report in that its goal is to tell you the good, the bad, and the ugly about how traffic gets to your site. Except in the case, instead of grouping it into larger channels, it's more focused on identifying actual, specific sources of traffic. This ability to pinpoint sources of high-quality traffic and separate that from poor-performing traffic sources, is critical to our success. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
In general, the all traffic report provides some of the most fundamental information a web analytics package can offer in a simple, easy to adjust, report. Now, these are going to show which sources, which mediums and which campaigns are performing on your site, and perhaps this is important which ones are not.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Acquisition &gt; All referrals</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The referring sites is simply a fancy way to describe sites that link to you, or in other words sites that refer traffic to you. Google Analytics has the ability to detect an incoming visit from a link and then it records that link down as the referring site. From then on, anything that is done during that visit including a goal or a transaction, will be credited or attributed back to that referring source.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
To find out on which page the referrals are sending the traffic, you can add a secondary dimension of "landing page". Click on a link (like Youtube.com for example) to see the exact referring path. Then if you want to see the exact page, just click on the little icon next to the name in the data table. With this report, you can determine not only who is sending that traffic, but just as importantly, who sends that quality traffic that's going to convert on my particular goals.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Acquisition &gt; Social reports</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Overview<br class="wikidpad" />
The Overview starts giving us the overall impact of social to our bottom line. We see these concentric circles aimed to show the part that social plays in the customer journey. The dark blue ones here are where social was the source that led directly to the site visit where their conversion happened. Call that the last click interaction. The light blue above it are the amounts where social contributed somewhere in the funnel, but was not the most recent activity. The other circle is the overall site conversions. And this gives us a sense of how much social does or doesn't contribute to our overall success of the site<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
2. Network Referrals<br class="wikidpad" />
We see both the sessions that were referred from a social site against all of our site traffic down here in orange. This allows us to see if there are correlations between the two and some overall patterns. On scrolling down, we see a table of social sites and the metrics that are associated with each including sessions, page views and the standard engagement metrics of time on site and pages per session.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
3. Data Hub Activity. <br class="wikidpad" />
This is going to show us activity on social sites that may never have even hit our site. Twitter and Facebook do not provide any data here<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
4. Landing Pages<br class="wikidpad" />
Brings us a list of our top landing pages from social channels<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
5. Trackbacks<br class="wikidpad" />
Gives us an idea of when people are linking back to our site in social posts and how many people are following those links. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
6. Conversions <br class="wikidpad" />
Specific report to note how many of those social network referrals are converting on our site and to what degree. An interesting part of this report is to go up here to the top and select Assisted versus Last Interaction Analysis. What this is going to show us is similar to those circles that we saw in the Overview report, as it attempts to show us a time where social referrers were the last thing that happened right before the converting session, versus when they may have sent the user to the site earlier, maybe few days ago, maybe few weeks ago.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
7. Plugins<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
8. Users Flow. <br class="wikidpad" />
This is going to be a user flow that simply defaults the same user flow we saw earlier in the course to a dimension of social networks. So we can see which social networks led to which starting pages, what their interactions were, what their drop offs were, we can follow their path through the site, and everything that we learned how to do in the user flow one except starting with the dimension of social.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Acquisition &gt; Keywords &gt; Organic</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Some poeple say that Organic keyword reports aren't that useful now that Google stopped allowing you to see the search phrases. Instead, you see : "not provided". But, we can still see the amount of traffic coming through that is coming from the organic source.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If you want to have an idea of the keywords people used, you can head over to Acquisition &gt; Search Engine Optimization &gt; Queries. However, you will have to link your Google Analytics account with your Google Webmaster Tools first.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Behavior &gt; Behavior Flow</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Make sure you fist select Automatically Grouped Pages. On the left, you will have all your Landing Pages. Landing pages are the only chances we have to make a first impression, and understanding how users enter and exit the site can tell us a lot about performance and user behaviours. Behavior Flow is a great place to start visually understanding that behavior, so we can start to optimize it. I highly encourage you just to dive into these reports, check out some different dimensions, and see what you can find about your site.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Behaviour &gt; Site Content &gt; All pages</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
From here you can see which content is causing the users to bounce or which one is particularly sticky. For example you could go in comparison and select bounce rate. To fix the bounce rate, you can analyze what keyword people have been using and compare that with the content of your page.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can also use this report to find pages that share the same title but different URL by clicking on the tab Page Title. Then if you click on one of the page titles, it will drill down on it and show you a list of all the URLs that share this page title. It is usually good practice to have different titles for all the different pages of your website.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Behavior &gt; Site Content &gt; Content drill-down</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Depending on your site's architecture, the content drill-down report provides a unique and very efficient reporting tool to analyze your site's content. This can be useful because some pages should be grouped together, for example each of your blog pages may not compete against the "career" section of the site but it would make sense to put all the blog pages into one group. If your site is divided into sub-directories, it's actually going to be very easy to achieve.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Behaviour &gt; Site content &gt; Landing pages</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
For example you could analyze by city how many session ended up on the Training landing page so that you know in which city to host a conference.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Landing page analysis is really important because optimizing our landing pages is one of the easiest and most effective things we can do to improve site conversions.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Behaviour &gt; Site Search</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It is common to see less than 10% of traffic to use the search functionality of your website. It is also common to see that 50% of the people who have purchased used the site search.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Under site search, you have a page report. You can look at where the user was before searching. So if a user was on "Google Analytics Premium" and the user started searching about "Google Analytics Premium", you can tell that the page failed them... These search reports are well worth your time to explore.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Configuring your site search:<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Make a search on your website (example: Claudie)<br class="wikidpad" />
2. Look in the URL and see what term is used to identify the keyword searched for (in LOG, it is "s") <span class="wikidpad url-link"><a href="http://www.lesbianoutdoorgroup.ca/?s=test" class="wikidpad">http://www.lesbianoutdoorgroup.ca/?s=test</a></span><br class="wikidpad" />
3. Go to Google Analytics &gt; Admin &gt; View settings <br class="wikidpad" />
4. Turn Site Search Setting ON<br class="wikidpad" />
5. Fill the keyword used (LOG is s)<br class="wikidpad" />
6. Makes sense to check the box to strip out the search parameters. Site search category is like Amazon where you can search for books or music etc.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Intelligence report</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Now, there are two different ways I use this tool. The first I'll call Forensic and the second we'll call Insights. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
In Forensic mode what I'm really looking for, are things I see in various reports that are jumping out at me, but I can't necessarily explain it. Having a look at Daily Events where Google Analytics store particular events can help. Basically Google is going through every single report every day and logging the anomalies.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
In Insight mode, I'm expecting Google to surface for me things that I would otherwise miss. In other words, one of the great things about these intelligence reports, is that it lets us look for that needle in a haystack, except I don't even necessarily know the needle exists, Google is going to figure that out too. So it would be a matter of just going through each list of alerts and discover interesting insights.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can create custom alerts by going to Intelligence Events &gt; Overview &gt; Custom Alerts &gt; Manage Customized Alerts &gt; New Alert<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
A good way of getting alerted if Google Analytics is broken (after an update to your website for example) is to set up an alert when pageview decreases by 60% (comparing same day in previous week). Or you can also set up an alert if the organic traffic suddenly drops, which would mean that you don't appear as much in search engine search results anymore.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Various tabs in the report view</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The first tab is "Summary", the default view.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The idea is to pull in metrics that represents each phase of the customer journey:<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Acquire customers<br class="wikidpad" />
2. Measure their behaviour on the site through what are commonly known as engagement metrics<br class="wikidpad" />
3. Measure the outcomes which are represented in the conversion section.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The second tab is Site Usage<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Gives us some information about how people are actually using the information on our site through these engagement metrics. We have sessions, pages per session, average session duration, percentage of new sessions, and bounce rate. This information is going to be broken down on the left by source and media. We can see for each of these different sources how these metrics are doing.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The next time is goal (when you have some that are set)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The tab is E-commerce: This is going to give us the dollars and cents, exactly how much each of these visits are worth. How much money are these traffic sources bringing in.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can create a brand new view of this report by clicking on "Customization" and then select the exact columns you want to see.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Real-life example. Consider these two campaigns, and let's figure out which one is better:<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Cost		ROI			Revenue			Per visit value<br class="wikidpad" />
$8,999.93	273.93%		$14,793.82		$1.41<br class="wikidpad" />
$1,499.90	1058.45%	$7,750.54		$3.22<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Although the numbers are widely different, when you do Revenue minus cost, they are essentially almost the same: $5,793.89 vs. $6,070.64<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Consider now this example:<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Visit		Clicks		Cost<br class="wikidpad" />
10,473		10,486		$8,999.93<br class="wikidpad" />
5,910		5,080		$774.33<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If you only look at number of visits, you'd consider the first campaign to be more successful, which is absolutely not the case. ($5,793.89 vs $37,941.96)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It is hard to pick the right metric to concentrate on. If you look at each metric, you could go back and forth on which campaign was better. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Filters</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
There are 3 types of filters:<br class="wikidpad" />
- View filters (formerly known as profile filters): Set up under admin &gt; View &gt; Filter<br class="wikidpad" />
- Quick inline filters: Filters are the top of the data table in the reports<br class="wikidpad" />
- Advanced filters<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
--Inline filters--<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
For example, if you are in the geo &gt; Language report and want to report on spanish speakers, you can click on "ES", but certain browser report spanish differently (ES, ES-SP, etc.) So using the search box, you can type ES and it will give you all the lines that contain ES. The top row will then give you the total for all spanish users.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
--Advanced filters--<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
For example if you want to compare iPad users vs iPhone, you could click on the Advanced link next to the search box, and fill the following information:<br class="wikidpad" />
- Include<br class="wikidpad" />
- Mobile Device Info<br class="wikidpad" />
- Matching RegExp<br class="wikidpad" />
- iPhone|iPad<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
(if you create two rows with equal instead of MatchingRegExp, it will not work because you cannot change the AND in between in to an OR.)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
In the advance filter, you can also filter on elements that are not even on the report.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
A large part of what we're doing in metrics is evaluating quality. And we often do this with rates, bounce rates, conversion rates, e-commerce conversion rates and so on. The problem is that sorting by rate, means that we're dominated by outliers (for example just one session, the person bought something, so that means 100% conversion rate). You can see this in action in the Behaviour &gt; Site Content &gt; All pages report. To fix this problem, you could go in advanced filters and remove pageviews of under 5 for example, but there is another way.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Sort type &gt; instead of Default, pick "weighted"<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Now you will see bounce rate rated by pageviews. However, you may not like the Algorithm that Google is using to generate the new bounce rate values.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
There is another option in that "sort", called Absolute Change. It will be grayed out unless you do a comparison by date (see above on how to do that)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Segmentation</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Examples, segmenting by:<br class="wikidpad" />
- Country<br class="wikidpad" />
- Region<br class="wikidpad" />
- Search Engine<br class="wikidpad" />
- Keyword<br class="wikidpad" />
- etc.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Let's use Acquisition &gt; Channels report: Here you can see which search engine was used to access your site by clicking Organic Search and changing the primary Dimension to be "source". Note that by doing that, you are segmenting a segment.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Let's go to Audience &gt; Geo &gt; Location. From this you can click on a country on the map or a country name on the list to drill down to the various regions.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can segment by drilling down on elements. For example, being in the Audience &gt; Technology &gt; Browser and OS report, you can click on Flash Version and in the data table, click on not set. So now you are segmenting your report to see just the people that don't have Flash (proof in the breadcrumb at the top). Now from there, you could then click on "other" in the tabs area to set the primary dimension to something different, such as operating system, and find out what OS these non-Flash users are using.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">User management</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
User management is done under Admin &gt; User Management (which exists under Account, Property and View).<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can use it to grant access or restrict access.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Different possible permissions:<br class="wikidpad" />
- Manage Users<br class="wikidpad" />
- Edit<br class="wikidpad" />
- Collaborate<br class="wikidpad" />
- Read &amp; Analyze<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It is recommended to use corporate e-mail accounts that you then link to a google account to access Analytics (security reasons, because anybody can open an account called John_smith_123@gmail.com even though their name is not John Smith.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">E-mailing report</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Configure your report<br class="wikidpad" />
2. Scroll back to the top and click "e-mail"<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If you already have a report that is being e-mailed on a certain frequency, when you click e-mail for another report, you will see an option in the bottom right corner to "add to an existing e-mail"<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Social Media</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If you have a Facebook Like or a Twitter Tweet button on your site, you want to track how many times those buttons were pressed on the various content pages of your site such as a particular blog post. These are known as social plugins for your site. Note that Google +1 buttons are automatically tracked by Google Analytics without you having to do anything further. But outside of Google+, the social data from these elements on your site will have to be sent in by embedding special tracking code in the page to detect the interaction with these buttons. And that's outside the scope of this course, but I do want you to be aware that it exists<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Campaigns</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If you have add on various websites, instead of giving them your plain link "acme.com/redbox.html", you can add more information in the link like this:<br class="wikidpad" />
acme.com/redbox.html?utm_campaign=redboxes&amp;utm_media=display&amp;utm_source=boxafficionadosmagazine.com&amp;utm_content=banner-red<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Each parameters correspond to these values below:<br class="wikidpad" />
Campain: redboxes<br class="wikidpad" />
Medium: display<br class="wikidpad" />
Source: boxafficionadosmagazine.com<br class="wikidpad" />
Version: banner-red<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can use the URL builder if you need help: <span class="wikidpad url-link"><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en" class="wikidpad">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en</a></span><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can test your URL by accessing it and checking the Traffic Source report under Real-Time to make sure that the information is being read by Google Analytics properly<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Another example to track e-mail campaigns:<br class="wikidpad" />
Campaign: maturityassessment<br class="wikidpad" />
Medium: email<br class="wikidpad" />
Source: newsletterlist<br class="wikidpad" />
Content: (various links inside the e-mail can be tagged to various content. So takesurvey vs headline link)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Another medium is "social"<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If trying to track offline campaign, use different URLs (short) that will redirect (301 redirect) to the long version<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can use these utm_source and utm_medium in the URL to exactly identify one session in your Google Analytics data if you want to test out something for example.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Anatomy of a URL</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<span class="wikidpad url-link"><a href="http://www.domain.com/myContent/myPage.html" class="wikidpad">http://www.domain.com/myContent/myPage.html</a></span><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<span class="wikidpad url-link"><a href="http://" class="wikidpad">http://</a></span> Protocol<br class="wikidpad" />
www.mydomain.com: hostname<br class="wikidpad" />
myContent/myPage.html: URI<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The URI is what's going to populate all the Google Analytics content reports.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Dashboard</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
To create a new dashboard, click on Dashboard &gt; New. Then you need to add widgets. If you want to link to a particular report, you can type the URL or you can just start typing the name.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
From any report, you can add to dashboard using a button at the very top of the report.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Notes</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If you are expecting to see data that you don't see, make sure that the date range includes today.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If you don't know what a specific metric mean, click on the question mark next to it.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Page value: How it works, is that when a transaction happens or a goal is achieved, the revenue or the goal value, is divided up amongst all the unique page views that were part of that visit prior to that transaction. So, if a page is repeatedly part of that set, it'll gain more and more value over time<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<a name=".h43257" class="wikidpad"></a><h3 class="wikidpad heading-level3">Google Analytics Tips</h3>
How is it possible to have more page views than sessions? Because the session is only counted once on the landing page. Here is how things are calculated in Google Analytics:<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
User Alice visits the following page: Home - About us - Home<br class="wikidpad" />
User Bob visits the following pages: Privacy - About us<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Pages	Pageviews	Sessions	Unique PV	Entrances	Users<br class="wikidpad" />
Home		2			1			1			1		  1<br class="wikidpad" />
About us	2			0			2			0		  2<br class="wikidpad" />
Privacy		1			1			1			1		  1<br class="wikidpad" />
Total		5			2			4			2		  2<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
- Things get a little weird when you're starting to combine hit-level dimensions and session-level metrics.<br class="wikidpad" />
- Only the first hit of the session is associated with the Sessions metric<br class="wikidpad" />
- That doesn't mean the hit isn't associated with the session for filters, just the Sessions metric<br class="wikidpad" />
- Sessions equal Entrances (usually) -&gt;The difference happens when the session starts on an event<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Investigate the Google Analytics Query Explorer tool to get IDs of different things like segments<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can use Google Drive to export your reports to Excel, you can create charts from the data and export those as images and that will give you a link. Accessing the link will always show you the image up to date with the latest data.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Misunderstanding with segments</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
1. AND condition<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Filter on session:<br class="wikidpad" />
Page = Training page<br class="wikidpad" />
And<br class="wikidpad" />
Page = Homepage<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
This condition will work (surprisingly). Google here will show you sessions where people visited both these pages.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
However:<br class="wikidpad" />
Filter on user:<br class="wikidpad" />
Page = Training page<br class="wikidpad" />
And<br class="wikidpad" />
Page = Homepage<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
This will NOT work.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
But you can do this<br class="wikidpad" />
Filter on user:<br class="wikidpad" />
Page = Training page<br class="wikidpad" />
(and then don't have either AND or OR, just create a new filter)<br class="wikidpad" />
Page = Home page<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
This will bring you back all the users that have visited both the training page and the home page at some point (doesn't have to be in the same session).<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
2. Include vs. Exclude<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Condition A: Include Page != ContactTrue (the thank you page after submitting a form)<br class="wikidpad" />
Condition B: Exclude Page = ContactTrue<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Corey: Home page &gt; Blog &gt; Training page &gt; Video &gt; About us<br class="wikidpad" />
David: Home page &gt; About us &gt; Form Start &gt; Form Submit &gt; ContactTrue &gt; Home page<br class="wikidpad" />
<ul class="wikidpad normalindent">Condition A		Condition B</ul>
Corey			Y				Y<br class="wikidpad" />
David			Y				N<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Condition A basically says "Show me all the users who have ever hit a page that was anything other than the ContactTrue page"<br class="wikidpad" />
Condition B says: "Find the existence of people who visited this page and then exclude those people"<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
3. Filtering from both user and session<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
On session:<br class="wikidpad" />
Country = United States<br class="wikidpad" />
On user:<br class="wikidpad" />
Revenue per user &gt;= 100<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
- First, the USER will be filtered<br class="wikidpad" />
- THEN the session-based condition will be applied<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Therefore, let's say Alice has two sessions:<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 1: $25, Canada<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 2: $80, US<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Alice passes filter 1 because she has $105 total revenue, but only her session 2 will appear in the report: Total revenue: $80, even though our filter indicated $100. That's because she did have $100 when we were including all the sessions that were later removed due to the session filter.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Another example<br class="wikidpad" />
Filter on user:<br class="wikidpad" />
Session duration &gt; 300s<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Alice<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 1: 350s<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 2: 200s<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Bob<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 1: 400s<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Charlie<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 1: 200s<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 2: 200s<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Alice will make it in (both sessions), Bob will make it in, Charlie is not included<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Another example at the "hit" level<br class="wikidpad" />
Filter on user:<br class="wikidpad" />
Product Revenue per hit &gt;= 50<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Alice<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 1: $25 $35	Total: $60<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 2: $10 		Total: $10<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Bob<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 1: $10 $75 	Total: $85<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Charlie: <br class="wikidpad" />
Session 1: $55 $10	Total: $65<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 2: $20		Total $20<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Alice is out, Bob is in, Charlie is in and the total revenue of the segment is: $85 + $65 + $20 ($170)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
4. Sequence segments<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Filter include user<br class="wikidpad" />
Step 1: Session duration &gt;= 300s<br class="wikidpad" />
Step 2: Transaction per hit &gt; 0<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Alice: <br class="wikidpad" />
Session 1: No transaction, 300s<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 2: 1 transaction, 200s<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Bob: No transaction, 400s<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Charlie: <br class="wikidpad" />
Session 1: 1 transaction, 200s<br class="wikidpad" />
Session 2: no transaction, 350s<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Alice is in but Charlie is out because the steps are not in the proper order.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Custom Definitions</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
In Admin &gt; Property &gt; Custom Definitions<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
So it's something to investigate again but you can for example match author_id with actual names and then you can investigate in GA which author has most views and things like that<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Time zone tips</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Once the data is in the system, there's no going back<br class="wikidpad" />
2. If you need to view the data from different time zone perspective, create different views for each time zone<ul class="wikidpad normalindent">-&gt; Note that the London view and the US view may record the same visit on different days because of the time difference<br class="wikidpad" />
</ul>
<b class="wikidpad">Custom reports</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You have to be very careful with the granularity. For example, you can't build a report that tries to match page-level scope and session-level scope. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
For example, whether you convert or not in a session is something that applies to that entire session. But how may page views a particular page has is a page level scope. So it makes no sense to create a content report that reports the number of page views and the conversion rate for a page. A page itself can't convert, a user converts in a session based on the goals you set up which may or may not include that page.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Documentation on the various scopes here: <span class="wikidpad url-link"><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets" class="wikidpad">https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets</a></span> (select web mode)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
A quicker way of building a custom report is to start from an existing report, go to the top of the page and click "customise". For example you could customize the language report to drill down into Country (instead of drilling down further into Language).<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Google Analytics Universal</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
One user + multiple device = One user in Universal<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If you upgrade, you will have to do retagging for the following:<br class="wikidpad" />
- Events<br class="wikidpad" />
- Ecommerce<br class="wikidpad" />
- Custom Variables<br class="wikidpad" />
- Virtual Pageviews<br class="wikidpad" />
- Social Interactions<br class="wikidpad" />
- User Timings<br class="wikidpad" />
- Cross-domain tracking<br class="wikidpad" />
- Subdirectory tracking<br class="wikidpad" />
- Sampling<br class="wikidpad" />
- Enhanced Link Attribution<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Permanent view Filters vs Segments</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<ul class="wikidpad normalindent">-Filters-						-Advanced Segments-</ul>
Hit based								Visit Based (and now user based too)<br class="wikidpad" />
Forward looking only					Can look retroactively	<br class="wikidpad" />
Can affect IP Address					Cannot segment on IPs<br class="wikidpad" />
Can write data (pre-pend subdomain)		Doesn't write data, just build subsets for analysis<br class="wikidpad" />
For data cleanup						For analysis<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Permanent filters should be applied to NEW views because it is NOT retroactive and it probably doesn't make sense to look at data where the filter was not applied at first and suddenly started to be applied. Filters are permanent, and they are destructive.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Cohort</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
A cohort is a group of people who are tied together by some common characteristic. They're generally grouped around a certain defined time period. It's not just looking at time periods such as people who buy on their first visit, or if they bounce. We're actually identifying a group of people and then we're following them as time passes. But we're not updating that definition, we stick with that original group<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Create a new segment using Date of First visit as your criteria (to identify people who have seen that clever Superbowl ad you just ran)<br class="wikidpad" />
2. Create the exact same segment but for one week prior<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Date range cohort is limited to 31 days. And we also want to remember that these are user segments that we are using here, and so we know those can only go 90 days back<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Filtering internal traffic</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Recommended to filter out by IP address. Don't look at your computer IP address, just Google "What is my IP address?" and use that. This is your External IP address. IP address is only accessible through view filters.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Filters everyone should have</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Note: When you do a custom filter on a view, if you use "include", it doesn't just mean Include, it's also going to EXCLUDE everything else. The filter pattern field is a regular expression field, so if you put your IP address there, you should put a backslash before each dot to escape it.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
1. lowercase<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
This filter will cleanup your data before it even hits your account. Apply to medium, source and campaign name (three different filters)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Advanced segments</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
You can see up to 4 segments at a given time. You can create your own segment by clicking "new segment". When you segment by user, you have a 90 day look back window (example: total purchase per user).    </body>
