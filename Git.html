<b class="wikidpad">Vocabulary</b><br class="wikidpad" />
Directory: A folder used for storing multiple files.<br class="wikidpad" />
Repository: A directory where Git has been initialized to start version controlling your files.<br class="wikidpad" />
staged: Files are ready to be committed.<br class="wikidpad" />
unstaged: Files with changes that have not been prepared to be commited.<br class="wikidpad" />
untracked: Files aren't tracked by Git yet. This usually indicates a newly created file.<br class="wikidpad" />
deleted: File has been deleted and is waiting to be removed from Git.<br class="wikidpad" />
Staging Area: A place where we can group files together before we "commit" them to Git.<br class="wikidpad" />
Commit: A "commit" is a snapshot of our repository. This way if we ever need to look back at the changes we've made (or if someone else does), we will see a nice timeline of all changes.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Commands</b><br class="wikidpad" />
git init: To initialize a directory<br class="wikidpad" />
git status: to see what the current state of the project is<br class="wikidpad" />
git add [filename]: Tell git to start tracking this file<br class="wikidpad" />
git commit -m "Add cute octocat story": commit command with a message describing what we've changed<br class="wikidpad" />
git log: Shows all our changes<br class="wikidpad" />
git remote add origin <span class="wikidpad url-link"><a href="https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git" class="wikidpad">https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git</a></span>: To push our local repo to the GitHub server we'll need to add a remote repository. This command takes a remote name and a repository URL<br class="wikidpad" />
git push -u origin master: The push command tells Git where to put our commits when we're ready. The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master. The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do.<br class="wikidpad" />
git pull origin master: check for changes on our GitHub repository and pull down any new changes<br class="wikidpad" />
git diff HEAD: diff of our most recent commit, which we can refer to using the HEAD pointer.<br class="wikidpad" />
git diff --staged: see the changes you just staged<br class="wikidpad" />
git reset octofamily/octodog.txt: You can unstage files by using the git reset command<br class="wikidpad" />
git checkout -- octocat.txt: Files can be changed back to how they were at the last commit by using the command: git checkout -- <target>. <br class="wikidpad" />
git branch clean_up: When developers are working on a feature or bug they'll often create a copy (aka. branch) of their code they can make separate commits to.<br class="wikidpad" />
git checkout clean_up: You can switch branches using the git checkout <branch> command. <br class="wikidpad" />
git rm '*.txt': removes all the .txt  which will not only remove the actual files from disk, but will also stage the removal of the files for us.<br class="wikidpad" />
git merge clean_up: merge your changes from the clean_up branch into the master branch<br class="wikidpad" />
git branch -d <branch name>: delete a branch<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
add all:<br class="wikidpad" />
You can also type git add -A . where the dot stands for the current directory, so everything in and beneath it is added. The -A ensures even file deletions are included.<br class="wikidpad" />
git reset:<br class="wikidpad" />
You can use git reset <filename> to remove a file or files from the staging area.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
More useful logs:<br class="wikidpad" />
Use git log --summary to see more information for each commit. You can see where new files were added for the first time or where files were deleted. It's a good overview of what's going on in the project.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
git remote: Git doesn't care what you name your remotes, but it's typical to name your main one origin.<br class="wikidpad" />
It's also a good idea for your main repository to be on a remote server like GitHub<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Cool Stuff:<br class="wikidpad" />
When you start to get the hang of git you can do some really cool things with hooks when you push.<br class="wikidpad" />
For example, you can upload directly to a webserver whenever you push to your master remote instead of having to upload your site with an ftp client. Check out Customizing Git - Git Hooks for more information. (<span class="wikidpad url-link"><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks" class="wikidpad">http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks</a></span>)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
git stash:<br class="wikidpad" />
Sometimes when you go to pull you may have changes you don't want to commit just yet. One option you have, other than commiting, is to stash the changes.<br class="wikidpad" />
Use the command 'git stash' to stash your changes, and 'git stash apply' to re-apply your changes after your pull.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
HEAD<br class="wikidpad" />
The HEAD is a pointer that holds your position within all your different commits. By default HEAD points to your most recent commit, so it can be used as a quick way to reference that commit without having to look up the SHA.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Commit Etiquette:<br class="wikidpad" />
You want to try to keep related changes together in separate commits. Using 'git diff' gives you a good overview of changes you have made and lets you add files or directories one at a time and commit them separately.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The '--'<br class="wikidpad" />
So you may be wondering, why do I have to use this '--' thing? git checkout seems to work fine without it. It's simply promising the command line that there are no more options after the '--'. This way if you happen to have a branch named octocat.txt, it will still revert the file, instead of switching to the branch of the same name.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Branching<br class="wikidpad" />
Branches are what naturally happens when you want to work on multiple features at the same time. You wouldn't want to end up with a master branch which has Feature A half done and Feature B half done.<br class="wikidpad" />
Rather you'd separate the code base into two "snapshots" (branches) and work on and commit to them separately. As soon as one was ready, you might merge this branch back into the master branch and push it to the remote server.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
All at Once<br class="wikidpad" />
You can use:<br class="wikidpad" />
git checkout -b new_branch<br class="wikidpad" />
to checkout and create a branch at the same time. This is the same thing as doing:<br class="wikidpad" />
git branch new_branch<br class="wikidpad" />
git checkout new_branch<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Remove all the things!<br class="wikidpad" />
Removing one file is great and all, but what if you want to remove an entire folder? You can use the recursive option on git rm:<br class="wikidpad" />
git rm -r folder_of_cats<br class="wikidpad" />
This will recursively remove all folders and files from the given directory.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The '-a' option<br class="wikidpad" />
If you happen to delete a file without using 'git rm' you'll find that you still have to 'git rm' the deleted files from the working tree. You can save this step by using the '-a' option on 'git commit', which auto removes deleted files with the commit.<br class="wikidpad" />
git commit -am "Delete stuff"<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Pull Requests<br class="wikidpad" />
If you're hosting your repo on GitHub, you can do something called a pull request.<br class="wikidpad" />
A pull request allows the boss of the project to look through your changes and make comments before deciding to merge in the change. It's a really great feature that is used all the time for remote workers and open-source projects.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Force delete<br class="wikidpad" />
What if you have been working on a feature branch and you decide you really don't want this feature anymore? You might decide to delete the branch since you're scrapping the idea. You'll notice that git branch -d bad_feature doesn't work. This is because -d won't let you delete something that hasn't been merged.<br class="wikidpad" />
You can either add the --force (-f) option or use -D which combines -d -f together into one command.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">The .git directory</b><br class="wikidpad" />
You'll notice a .git directory. It's usually hidden but we're showing it to you for convenience.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
If you click it you'll notice it has all sorts of directories and files inside it. You'll rarely ever need to do anything inside here but it's the guts of Git, where all the magic happens.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Learning more about Git</b><br class="wikidpad" />
We only scratched the surface of Git in this course. There is so much more you can do with it. Check out the Git documentation for a full list of functions. <span class="wikidpad url-link"><a href="http://git-scm.com/docs" class="wikidpad">http://git-scm.com/docs</a></span><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The Pro Git book, by Scott Chacon, is an excellent resource to teach you the inner workings of Git.<br class="wikidpad" />
