<br class="wikidpad" />
1. Match Font Personality with Content<br class="wikidpad" />
2. Set a hierarchy of meaning<br class="wikidpad" />
3. Follow the basic pairing rule (pairing serif with sans serif<br class="wikidpad" />
4. Limit font usage (2 to 3 at most)<ul class="wikidpad normalindent">One for headings, one for content and MAYBE another one for special accents like navigation, author name or blog details<br class="wikidpad" />
</ul>

In print, the preference is to choose a serif font for body text because it's generally considered easier to read. On the web, it doesn't matter as much though it is recommended to mix one with the other (headings vs paragraphs)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
When you're choosing font weights, stick with normal font weights for body text, and reserve any light, bold or condensed weights, if you use them at all, for your headings. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Your type style refers to normal and italic fonts which sometimes are called Roman and Oblique. Occasionally, people also include Condensed and Extended font families in this category, but not Bold text. Bold text is treated as a type weight, rather than a style. So, in general, I'd like you to stick with Roman for body text and really reserve Italics, Condensed and Extended fonts styles, for things like headings or for emphasis on smaller blocks of text.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
A block of text with too wide or too narrow a measure, or line length, can completely disrupt the reader's rhythm. So, in general, the measure is determined by the font size, but unfortunately, there is no one perfect calculation that all designers use, so instead try an equation that's roughly four times the font size, to get the maximum number of characters per line. For instance, if your type is 16 point, your measure can be about 60 to 65 characters long. While measure is proportional to font size, for improved readability try not to ever go wider than about 70 characters, which is roughly 600 pixels in paragraph widths.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Your line height should be proportionate with your line length. The default as you probably already see in Adobe software and most browsers, is 120 percent of the font's size. So if you increase or decrease your line height, you can actually add interest and focus.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Paragraph spacing refers to the repetitive breaks of space between paragraphs. Most designers create this space for paragraphs and headings by adding top or bottom padding or margins in the CSS. For best results, use one-half the size of the body text line height for your paragraph spacing. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Letterspacing refers to the tracking or added uniform space between all of the letters in a word or phrase. Only adjust the letterspacing for headlines with display type, which are any large fancy fonts used for headings or advertisements or for specialized uses like when creating a logo or logo type. Tracking the letters out within a word or phrase can add a sense of elegance and improve readability, while tightening the letterspacing typically makes the text more difficult to read.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Roughly 90% of all the text we read is comprised of lowercase letters. The coastline or the outline shape of lowercase lettering, is far easier to read than uppercase, which lacks a variable coastline, therefore, reserve your use of all caps and small caps, for display type and for areas of emphasis within your regular text<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
When we speak of typographic contrast, we normally think, first, in terms of font pairings, and then in terms of color. For best contrast and interest, pair serif with sans serif fonts. As for readability color is extremely important on the web. Light colors on dark backgrounds and dark colors on bright backgrounds are both extremely difficult combinations for readers to look at for an extended period of time. If needed, head over to Webaim.org's free contrast checker, where you can input your text and background colors to find a suitable contrast ratio. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The normal left-aligned ragged-right text is truly easier to read than justified text because of the clean left edge it creates. Justified text can be really great for books, newspapers and magazines, but on the web, it often makes horribly awkward gaps between words that disrupt the reader's rhythm. On the web, reserve justified type as well as type with center and right-alignment for special circumstances like headings, subheadings, buttons, banners, and poetry.     </body>
